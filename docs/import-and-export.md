# Import and Export


## Data Format

EncounterPlus is using XML files as a data exchange format, packed into ZIP archive along with other files (images, tokens, fonts, styles, etc..). 

A special file extension can be used for automatic import using Files app or Airdop transfer, although it's not necessary.
